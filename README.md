# Summary:
 This file is organized in different classes, each class is a collection of guidelines with examples.
 Some guidelines are more concrete and other are general ideas that improve code quality.
The file has a top-down organization from more general to more concrete things

1. General conventions  
1.1 - Naming Conventions  
1.2 - Class order  
1.3 - Valid Opposites  
1.3 - Project Abrevations

2. Layout and Style

3. Classes conventions  
3.1 - Class Order  
3.2 - Class Names  
3.3 - Class Considerations  

4. Events conventions

5. Properties conventions

6. Methods/Properties conventions  
6.1 Methods Naming Conventions  
6.2 - Routine Parameters Conventions  
6.3 - Methods return value conventions  
6.4 - Methods considerations


7. Variables conventions  
7.1 Variable Declarations  
7.2 Variable Names  
7.3 Numbers  
7.4 Characters And Strings  
7.5 Booleans  
7.6 Enums  
7.7 Arrays  

8. Statements Conventions  
8.1 - Conditionals  
8.2 - Loops

9. Commenting conventions

10. Unity Special Conventions  
10.1 - Coroutines

# Why i need it?
As stated in "Code Complete Second Editions" the purpose of this convention is the following:
[Code Complete Second Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670)

 ■ They let you take more for granted.By making one global decision rather than
 many local ones, you can concentrate on the more important characteristics of
 the code.

 ■ They help you transfer knowledge across projects.Similarities in names give you
 an easier and more confident understanding of what unfamiliar variables are
 supposed to do.

 ■ They help you learn code more quickly on a new project.Rather than learning
 that Anita’s code looks like this, Julia’s like that, and Kristin’s like something
 else, you can work with a more consistent set of code.

 ■ They reduce name proliferation. Without naming conventions, you can easily
 call the same thing by two different names.For example, you might call total
 points both pointTotal and totalPoints.This might not be confusing to you when
 you write the code, but it can be enormously confusing to a new programmer
 who reads it later.

# How to use it:
The idea is to include this file and the example file in your Unity project so you can open it quickly in order to check anything.
Discuss with your team this guide and modify it so that everyone feels happy with the result before starting to code

Because this guide has been designed to work with Unity projects, i have included some specific conventions.
Feel free to share this file with your team-mates .

# Expected feedback
Any kind of feedback is welcome, i would like to improve this guide and make it a standard
